# R-Statistical-Analysis
Code samples from Applied Statistical Analysis with R (Spring 2021 400-level class)

This code was from my final project, which used a pared down, edited version of the Human Connectome Project dataset. The principles of open science and reproducibility guided my coding.

For part 1 of the project, I completed several data wrangling tasks including merging several CSVs into a single data frame and renaming columns to maintain consistent formating.
For part 2, I used ggplot 2 to visualise my data and also provided a broad description of the results.
For part 3, I performed statistical modelling. I ran a multiple (univariate) regression on 3 independent variables and 1 dependent variable baed on a hypothesis.
For part 4, I simulated data for all independent and dependent variables. This section was aimed at simulating the power of the omnibus test of regression that I ran in part 3.
